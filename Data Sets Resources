## Open datasets and sources
In this data-driven world, some datasets are freely available for anyone to access, use, modify, and share. These are called open datasets.
Open datasets include a public license and are very useful for your journey as a Data Scientist. Some of the most informative open dataset sources are listed below.

Propriety datasets and sources
Proprietary datasets contain data primarily owned and controlled by specific individuals or organizations. This data is limited in distribution because it is sold with a licensing agreement.
Some data from private sources cannot be easily disclosed, like public data.

National security data, geological, geophysical, and biological data are examples of propriety data. Copyright laws or patents usually bind this type of data. Proprietary datasets that mainly contain sensitive information are less widely available than open datasets.

Some standard propriety dataset sources are listed below.
